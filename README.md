# Guess-the-Number-Game

The “Guess the Number” game is a simple yet captivating command-line game developed using Python. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player’s goal is to guess this number. The game provides feedback on whether the player’s guess is too high, too low, or correct, making it an enjoyable and challenging experience. This project is perfect for practicing Python programming skills, particularly in areas such as user input handling, random number generation, and control structures.
